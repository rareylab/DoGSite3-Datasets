Descriptions

The directory "TrainingDatasets" includes archives of the datasets for deriving new, more robust and reliable DoGSite parameters. The datasets were downloaded Here: http://www.ewit.ccb.tu-dortmund.de/ag-koch/prospeccts/ and were first published here: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006483

The directory "BenchmarkingDatasets" includes the datasets for assessing the performance of binding site prediction tools. The folder includes archives of the prepared and preprocessed PDB structures which were first published here: https://eldorado.tu-dortmund.de/handle/2003/38292?locale=de
