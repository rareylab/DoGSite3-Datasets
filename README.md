Descriptions

The directory "TrainingDatasets" includes archives of the datasets for deriving new, more robust and reliable DoGSite parameters. The datasets 
were downloaded here: http://www.ewit.ccb.tu-dortmund.de/ag-koch/prospeccts/ and were first published here: 
https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006483 (How to cite: Ehrt C, Brinkjost T, Koch O. A benchmark driven guide 
to binding site comparison: An exhaustive evaluation using tailor-made data sets (ProSPECCTs). PLoS Comput Biol, 2018, 14(11): e1006483.)

The directory "BenchmarkingDatasets" includes the datasets for assessing the performance of binding site prediction tools. The folder includes
archives of the prepared and preprocessed PDB structures which were first published here: https://eldorado.tu-dortmund.de/handle/2003/38292?locale=de
